## ‚ùî About me 

I'm Altaks, a 17 yo. french student who's learning programming languages in order to get a **FullStack Developer** status. I'm specializing myself in **back-end** languages such as Java, Python and C++.

I like learning about everything, especially about algorithms, optimization techniques, maths, physics and everything that concerns our world
I'd love to learn Kotlin to code on Android based machines, and JavaScript in order to pay my scholarship by developing websites for anyone.

## üèÖ Achievements 

Since I'm 12 yo. I developed plugins for Minecraft servers (Arqion for 1 year and ElementaryNetwork for one year and a half), some websites for friends and geeky stuff like these. 

I developed and managed this entire infrastructure of Arqion, based on BungeeCord and a bunch of Spigot servers.
It needed the development of home-made plugins such as economy plugins, player island plugins (it was a SkyBlock), moderation plugins, pets plugins and much more. Feel free to check these : [Plugins from Arqion](https://github.com/Altaks/ArqionPlugins)

When i was coding for ElementaryNetwork I was on a different project named ElementaryOdyssey. I was working alone and developed a full system of dungeons based on the Hack'N'Slash combat system. All the instructions to use the plugin are into the files of the plugin, but in french.

üéì I got to partipate to the CGL (a national programming contest) of april 2022.

## üì´ Contact me

You can contact me by many ways, by email to altair61.dev@gmail.com, dm on discord to AltŒ±ks#0397 (the second "a" is an "alpha" from the greek alphabet, be careful)
I'm currently not under any contracts so you can contact me to develop tiny/medium projects, I'd be glad to learn new things while offering my services
I'm not really active on Twitter so I dont't advise you to contact me by this way.
